                      <p >As every organization today undergoing digital transformation, cloud adoption is at a
                        historic
                        peak.
                        Many
                        researchers declare that by 2025 globally
                        85% of organizations adapt cloud-focused ecosystem. Among all the cloud storage systems available in the
                        market, AWS
                        is
                        swiftly transforming to be a global
                        choice for those looking forward to invest in progressive storage, scalability, and
                        reliability. But
                        switching to AWS needs thorough accuracy and
                        planning. Multiple challenges make a move in the way of people developing spectacular AWS
                        cloud
                        migration
                        strategies. This blog will put across
                        5 challenges you need to be mindful of while developing AWS Cloud migration strategy.

                      <p>
                        You should begin the cloud migration approach by analysing and estimating ongoing in-house
                        operations,
                        cloud,
                        or
                        hybrid environment. A clear organizational
                        overview can support you in finding what's in your ecosystem, realize dependencies, and also
                        help you
                        figure
                        out which data or assets will be easy to
                        handle and elements that require keen attention. As the intricacy of migrating functioning
                        applications
                        differs on various factors like lifespan,
                        ongoing architecture complexity, adaptations, licensing agreements integrations, and others.
                        A
                        clear
                        review
                        will help in crafting a powerful migration strategy,
                        nail down an approach, and get appropriate vulnerability migration strategies fixed for
                        rapid
                        and
                        efficient

                      <p >Though the cloud pushed boundaries to multiple opportunities, it also needs companies to
                         develop and implement powerful security policies to get authority.
                         Besides AWS providing multiple security services targeting your data, identities,
                         applications,
                         and devices, if you require additional security and compliance needs, you can opt for a wide
                         variety of security, identity, and compliance capabilities. You can use AWS Identity
                         Services
                         to handle resources and permission at scale.

                      <p>By the time you shift to AWS, you will witness a highly dynamic
                         setting that
                         constantly adjusts. Having contemporary techniques and approaches for tracking data or
                         reviewing
                         applications might no longer be appropriate. Instead, adopting Amazon CloudWatch
                         can
                         assist
                         in the progressive supervision of applications, offering you workable insights to swiftly

                         to

                         gathers
                         "monitoring and operational" data in the form of logs, metrics, and events you can get a
                         real-time and
                         bird view of your AWS instances. Also access complete visibility into their health and
                         well-being,

                      <p >Data is crucial for any organization as it piles up from day 1.
                         Pushing data is not as easy as you think, because you need to have crystal clarity of what
                         data
                         you are pushing, the reason behind pushing it, and what processing is required to raise the
                         quality bar, accessibility, and scalability. AWS provides a wide range of services and tools
                         to
                         help you migrate data sets like files and databases to images and tape backups. AWS tools
                         like
                         AWS storage gateway, AWS direct connect, and AWS Datasync will help you in extending
                         on-premises
                         applications and migrate the data between AWS cloud and on-premises data centre.

                      <p>Cloud provides a wide range of potentials for companies to take advantage of an at-pace
                        scenario. Anyways, effortless provision of services also triggers overall cost hikes. Smart
                        cost
                        management demands you to leverage multiple cost optimization potentials to decrease monthly
                        bills and also overpay. For example, when consumption is low, you can choose for
                        restructuring
                        your instances which will decrease the overall cost of ownership. Simultaneously, you can
                        count
                        on tools like AWS cost explorer to visualize, handle and optimize your cloud costs.

                      <p >A prime reason for most companies behind switching to the cloud is considering its flexibility.
                        Now the
                        question is how to acquire that flexibility on AWS? how do you confirm that applications
                        you
                        shift
                        to AWS are favourably flexible. One way to do this is to choose AWS Regions that offer
                        diverse,
                        physically divided accessibility zones joined through low-latency, high-throughput, and
                        redundant
                        networking.
